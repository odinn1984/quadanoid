## Quadanoid

A breakout clone with a twist!

There are no walls, only paddles and bricks.<br />
The idea is to use the paddles as walls and clear the level.<br />
Each level brick layout is randomly generated and everytime you clear a level the movement speed increases.

Let's see how far you can get :)

Enjoy!
